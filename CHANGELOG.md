# Changelog

## [0.1.25] - ...
- Redesigned networking to ensure control plane services communicate directly and not via `reverse-proxy`. This avoids circular service dependencies where `reverse-proxy` defines a route for `serviceX` and thus depends on `serviceX`, but `serviceX` depends on `serviceY` and tries to communicate with `serviceY` via `reverse-proxy` that is dependent on `serviceX`...

## [0.1.24] - ...
- Added named volume for `workspace`.

## [0.1.23] - ...
- First distributed release of FlintML. 

...

## [0.1.0] - ...
