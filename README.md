**FlintML** is the all-in-one, self-hosted ML platform for real-world teams. Simple, flexible, fast to deploy, and built for people solving actual problems—not chasing hype.


## <img src="docs/_assets/logo.png" alt="FlintML Logo" width="17"/> Why FlintML?

FlintML enables teams to deliver end-to-end ML quickly and with minimal infrastructure overhead. With FlintML, all key components of the MLOps process are centralised, providing an integrated and developer-centric experience.
